# ACM Train Scheduling Program
## Overview
The ACM Train Scheduling Program is a Python command-line program enabling users to input to manage and view train schedules. The program allows users to input train schedules, including their attributes such as train number, destination, and departure times, as well as view existing trains. 

## Features
* **Input Train Schedules**: Users can add new train schedules, specifying train number, station, and time of departure.
* **Verify and Modify** Entries: The program allows users to confirm or correct the entered information before finalizing it.
* **Search Schedules**: Users can search for train schedules by entering a specific train number to view related entries.
* **Data Storage**: Train schedules are stored in a text file, trainSchedule.txt.
